# An introduction to Seaborn:

[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) is a Python data visualization library based on [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It integrates closely with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data structures.

For a brief introduction to the ideas behind the library, you can read the [introductory notes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html) or the [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). Visit the [installation page](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html) to see how you can download the package and get started with it. You can browse the [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) to see some of the things that you can do with seaborn, and then check out the [tutorials](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) or [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html) to find out how.

Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.
